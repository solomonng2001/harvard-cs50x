This repository was created to document my progression throughout [Havard's CS50x Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/)'s 12 weeks-long course. 

Takeaways from this awesome class:
* Abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web programming
* Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Pointers and memory allocations in a low-level language such as C
* Realised that I absolutely love Python
    * Raises productivity by allowing one to focus on deploying ideas rather than working on low-level tasks such as deallocating memory
    * Extensive library of modules and APIs
