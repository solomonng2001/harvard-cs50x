===================================================================

It's time to choose your own adventure! Your assignment, quite simply, is to implement in Scratch any project of your choice, be it an interactive story, game, animation, or anything else, subject only to the following requirements:

-   Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.
-   Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
-   Your project must use at least one condition.
-   Your project must use at least one loop.
-   Your project must use at least one variable.
-   Your project must use at least one sound.
-   Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex thanÂ *Ivy's Hardest Game*. As such, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.
