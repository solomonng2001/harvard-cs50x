======================================================================================================

Determine how long it takes for a population to reach a particular size.

```
$ ./population
Start size: 100
End size: 200
Years: 9

```

[Background](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/labs/1/population/#background)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Say we have a population of `n` llamas. Each year, `n / 3` new llamas are born, and `n / 4` llamas pass away.

For example, if we were to start with `n = 1200` llamas, then in the first year, `1200 / 3 = 400` new llamas would be born and `1200 / 4 = 300` llamas would pass away. At the end of that year, we would have `1200 + 400 - 300 = 1300` llamas.

To try another example, if we were to start with `n = 1000` llamas, at the end of the year, we would have `1000 / 3 = 333.33` new llamas. We can't have a decimal portion of a llama, though, so we'll truncate the decimal to get `333` new llamas born. `1000 / 4 = 250` llamas will pass away, so we'll end up with a total of `1000 + 333 - 250 = 1083`llamas at the end of the year.

[Implementation Details](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/labs/1/population/#implementation-details)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Complete the implementation of `population.c`, such that it calculates the number of years required for the population to grow from the start size to the end size.

-   Your program should first prompt the user for a starting population size.
    -   If the user enters a number less than 9 (the minimum allowed population size), the user should be re-prompted to enter a starting population size until they enter a number that is greater than or equal to 9. (If we start with fewer than 9 llamas, the population of llamas will quickly become stagnant!)
-   Your program should then prompt the user for an ending population size.
    -   If the user enters a number less than the starting population size, the user should be re-prompted to enter an ending population size until they enter a number that is greater than or equal to the starting population size. (After all, we want the population of llamas to grow!)
-   Your program should then calculate the (integer) number of years required for the population to reach at least the size of the end value.
-   Finally, your program should print the number of years required for the llama population to reach that end size, as by printing to the terminal `Years: n`, where `n` is the number of years.
