===============================================================================

Simulate the inheritance of blood types for each member of a family.

```
$ ./inheritance
Generation 0, blood type OO
    Generation 1, blood type AO
        Generation 2, blood type OA
        Generation 2, blood type BO
    Generation 1, blood type OB
        Generation 2, blood type AO
        Generation 2, blood type BO

```

[Background](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/labs/5/#background)
----------------------------------------------------------------

A person's blood type is determined by two alleles (i.e., different forms of a gene). The three possible alleles are A, B, and O, of which each person has two (possibly the same, possibly different). Each of a child's parents randomly passes one of their two blood type alleles to their child. The possible blood type combinations, then, are: OO, OA, OB, AO, AA, AB, BO, BA, and BB.

For example, if one parent has blood type AO and the other parent has blood type BB, then the child's possible blood types would be AB and OB, depending on which allele is received from each parent. Similarly, if one parent has blood type AO and the other OB, then the child's possible blood types would be AO, OB, AB, and OO.

[Understanding](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/labs/5/#understanding)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Take a look at the distribution code in `inheritance.c`.

Notice the definition of a type called `person`. Each person has an array of two `parents`, each of which is a pointer to another `person` struct. Each person also has an array of two `alleles`, each of which is a `char` (either `'A'`, `'B'`, or `'O'`).

Now, take a look at the `main` function. The function begins by "seeding" (i.e., providing some initial input to) a random number generator, which we'll use later to generate random alleles. The `main` function then calls the `create_family` function to simulate the creation of `person` structs for a family of 3 generations (i.e. a person, their parents, and their grandparents). We then call `print_family` to print out each of those family members and their blood types. Finally, the function calls `free_family` to `free` any memory that was previously allocated with `malloc`.

The `create_family` and `free_family` functions are left to you to write!

[Implementation Details](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/labs/5/#implementation-details)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Complete the implementation of `inheritance.c`, such that it creates a family of a specified generation size and assigns blood type alleles to each family member. The oldest generation will have alleles assigned randomly to them.

-   The `create_family` function takes an integer (`generations`) as input and should allocate (as via `malloc`) one `person` for each member of the family of that number of generations, returning a pointer to the `person` in the youngest generation.
    -   For example, `create_family(3)` should return a pointer to a person with two parents, where each parent also has two parents.
    -   Each `person` should have `alleles` assigned to them. The oldest generation should have alleles randomly chosen (as by calling the `random_allele`function), and younger generations should inherit one allele (chosen at random) from each parent.
    -   Each `person` should have `parents` assigned to them. The oldest generation should have both `parents` set to `NULL`, and younger generations should have `parents` be an array of two pointers, each pointing to a different parent.

We've divided the `create_family` function into a few `TODO`s for you to complete.

-   First, you should allocate memory for a new person. Recall that you can use `malloc` to allocate memory, and `sizeof(person)` to get the number of bytes to allocate.
-   Next, we've included a condition to check if `generations > 1`.
    -   If `generations > 1`, then there are more generations that still need to be allocated. Your function should set both `parents` by recursively calling `create_family`. (How many `generations` should be passed as input to each parent?) The function should then set both `alleles` by randomly choosing one allele from each parent.
    -   Otherwise (if `generations == 1`), then there will be no parent data for this person. Both `parents` should be set to `NULL`, and each `allele` should be generated randomly.
-   Finally, your function should return a pointer for the `person` that was allocated.

The `free_family` function should accept as input a pointer to a `person`, free memory for that person, and then recursively free memory for all of their ancestors.

-   Since this is a recursive function, you should first handle the base case. If the input to the function is `NULL`, then there's nothing to free, so your function can return immediately.
-   Otherwise, you should recursively `free` both of the person's parents before `free`ing the child.
